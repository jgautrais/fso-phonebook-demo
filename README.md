# fso-phonebook-demo

React app derived from the phonebook app build during [FullStackOpen course 2021](https://fullstackopen.com/en/#course-contents).

Data is stored on express server, which handles get, delete, post and put requests.
I have added styles to the app with the 'styled components' library.
